# Fundamental data structures implemented in Ruby

This repository contains Ruby code implementing some basic data structures.

The point is to be as complete as possible while being succinct.

## Why study data structures?

The data structures implemented here form the core of most university computer
science courses on fundamental data structures.

These are _fundamental_ data structures in that they are built into the
standard libraries of most programming languages, and these built-in structures
are used in virtually all data structures programmers create.

They are worth studying for two main reasons. First, they are built using
common techniques worth understanding. Second, they offer opportunities for
students to think about trade-offs when making decisions about how to build
their own data structures.
